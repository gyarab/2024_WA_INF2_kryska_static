            In League of Legends, two teams, each consisting of five players, compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, which is located in their base. The game is set on a map called Summoner’s Rift, and each player controls a unique character known as a champion. These champions have distinct abilities, strengths, and playstyles, which fall into different roles, such as:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Top lane:</b> A solo lane for tanky or bruiser champions.</li>
            <li><b>Mid lane:</b> A solo lane typically for mages or assassins.</li>
            <li><b>Bot lane:</b> A duo lane with an attack-damage carry (ADC) and a support champion.</li>
            <li><b>Jungle:</b> A roaming role that collects buffs and assists other lanes.</li>
        </ol>
